## Discussion

| **Agenda  Item**  |  Owner| Description |
| ----------- | --- | ----------- |
| **Recent updates & recap** | | The call series have been resumed after two months on hold, due to summer break and lack of new API proposals. During this period, the API backlog WG has received a new drop (drop #2) from GSMA Open Gateway Prod Definition WS. | 
| **Current issues** |  |  |
| [#217](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/issues/217)  | China Mobile| **New API proposal: Click to Dial** Ericsson: any reference to charging model? Who pays for the call? </br> China Mobile: it is the enterprise company. Huawei also notes this API is also popular in other aggregators like Vonage and Twilio. </br></br> Vodafone: if P2P is the model established, it is then needed to get the CSP involved. Concerns on the API implementation -- it seems to involve the use of proprietary solutions on the underlay. Suggests sharing further information on available standard solutions (e.g. reflected on TRs), for API owner to get more support on the API proposal.<br> China Mobile: will do (AP 20230810-01). </br> </br> GSMA: is this API tied to a specific mobile generation, or is it available for 3G/4G/5G? <br> China Telecom: notes it is valid for 3G-5G. |
| **Closed issues** |  |  |
| [#192](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/issues/192)  | TelecomXChange | **Proposal for a New API for E.212/E.164 Mapping**</br> This API proposal has been withdrawn |
| [#239](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/issues/239) ([PR#237](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/pull/237)) | GSMA| **New API proposal: Identity API**</br> discussion moved to Identity and Consent Management Sub Project, specifically to issue [#15](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/issues/15). |
| **New issues** |  | |
| [#266](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/issues/266) ([PR#269](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/pull/269))  | KDDI| **New API proposal: KYC Match**</br> Vodafone: is it the same as Mobile Connect (MC)? </br> KDDI: it is different. </br> Vodafone: despite being different, it seems to cover similar use cases. We had some discussions on MC in the past, hence the question. </br> GSMA: MC is not aligned with CAMARA API design style documented in Commonalities |
| [#267](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/issues/267) ([PR#268](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/pull/268))  | KDDI, MTN| **New API proposal: KYC Fill-in**</br> KDDI notes that examples of B2B customers for this API   are banking and issurance companies. KDDI also clarifies that there are other operators in Japanese market which have launched the API commercially. </br></br> Huawei: KYC Fill-in and Match are pretty similar, so it suggests merging both into one single repository. </br> KDDI: one single repo (sub-project) and one single regular meeting for both APIs may be an option, but two APIs should be separate APIs, because input/output data is very much different. </br> TEF: whether it makes sense or not to merge the two services into one single repo (sub-project) is up to Technical Steering Committee to decide; for sure they may take any of the recommendations we give to them. </br></br> Huawei: what happens when fake info is provided, like name or birthdate, in the API input params? What measures the operator will implement/execute to avoid this fraud from happening? </br> TEF: we can revert this question to the GSMA Prod Definition WS, to see if they have an inmmediate feedback/response. It is also reminded to everyone that there is no need to clarify all questions once at a time; there are questions like this that might require further thinking, and whose answer can be provided in the middle of API lifecycle. </br> KDDI: it is precondition to provide these services/APIs such that operator owned data corresponds to validated data. </br> TEF: agree. 
| [#271](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/issues/271) ([PR#273](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/pull/273))  | China Telecom, Huawei| **New API proposal: Site to cloud (S2C) VPN**</br> Vodafone: is it only for fixed networks? </br> China Telecom: correct. </br> Vodafone: my interpretation is a kind of SD-WAN service. </br></br>TEF: is this API built atop an existing standard API, e.g. IETF API? If so, could you provide a pointer to the corresponding RFC? <br> China Telecom: yes, it is based on IETF RFC, but with some extensions to satisfy particular enterprise customers needs. Will post the reference to the RFC (AP 20230810-02) in the github issue.  |

## AoB

1. Next steps following API submission
- Proccess is detailed [here](https://github.com/camaraproject/Governance/blob/main/documentation/API-onboarding.md)
- API owners are encouraged to get more supporters (to strengthen their API proposals) before sending their APIs to the TSC for approval. Companies will need to send the information to TSC one week before next meeting (7th Sept). 
- Who will be responsible to send the API proposals to the TSC? API owner or API backlog chair? Chair to confirm (AP 20230810-03).

2.  "Meaning of ""validated with operators?" entry in [API proposal template](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/blob/main/Commonalities/documentation/API-proposal-template.md)
- It has been asked what is the intention/meaning of this template entry
- TEF clarifies that the aim is to specify if, apart from API owner, any other operator has validated the API proposal. A YES in this field means that the API has been validated by two (or more) operators. 

## Action Points

| AP Identifier | AP Owner | Status | Description |
| ------------- | -------- | ------ | ----------- |
| 20230810-01 | China Mobile| Open | To share further information/details on Click-to-Dial API, including references to existing standard documentation (e.g. 3GPP TS/TRs). This information shall be posted in [#217](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/issues/217) |
| 20230810-02 | China Telecom | Closed | To share the IETF document (RFC) specifying the network API on top of which S2C VPN API will be built. This information shall be posted in [#271](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/issues/271)|
| 20230810-03 | TEF | Open | To confirm who (whether API owner or API backlog chair) will be responsible for sending the API proposal to TSC for approval, one week before next TSC meeting (7th Sept)  |
